Day 1:

Tauras made the main design of the website and Jokubas made all of the JS code.

Day 2:

Jokubas changed CSS a little made it look better, organized the files, added comments, implimented search in biography page, fixed homepage buttons, added loading animation and it now gives an error when a superhero is not found.

Day 3:

Jokubas made a functional search bar with a dropdown if multiple heroes are found and fixed a couple of flaws.

Day 4:

Jokubas redesigned the entire page, added a bunch of animations, fixed hero searching
